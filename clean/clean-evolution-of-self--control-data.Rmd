## Purpose

This file imports the data from 

MacLeana, Evan L., et al (2014). The evolution of self-control. PNAS, 111(20), E2140-E2148. Retrieved from <http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1323533111>

and tidies it up, creating a single data file with brain region as a variable.

The data have already been gathered and saved as separate CSVs by brain area in `r params$csv_dir`.

## Import CSVs and create merged data file

Here are the steps we want to do for all of the evolution-of-self-control-specific files:

1. Import the CSV from `../data/csv/<brain-area>.csv`
2. Delete the second row since it contains comments we do not need.
3. Rename the variables to be shorter and more transparent
4. Add a variable called `Brain_area` equal to `<brain-area>`.
5. Clean data fields with +/- char
